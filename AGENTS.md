## Skills
A skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used.

### Available skills
- observable-framework: Build and maintain Observable Framework projects (pages, data loaders, components, config, build/preview/deploy workflows). Use when working in `@observablehq/framework` projects. (file: /Users/alirun/Streams/Projects/wheel-calc/skills/observable-framework/SKILL.md)

### How to use skills
- Trigger rule: If a user names `observable-framework` or the task is clearly about Observable Framework, use this skill for that turn.
- Missing/blocked: If the skill file cannot be read, continue with best-effort fallback and state the issue briefly.
